A fun and interactive **Number Guessing Game** built entirely using **C++**! This project challenges players to guess the correct number based on feedback and hints while showcasing my journey as a programmer.

## ✨ Features

- **Difficulty Levels**: 
  - Easy: 15 attempts.
  - Medium: 10 attempts.
  - Hard: 5 attempts.

- **Dynamic Feedback**: 
  - Real-time hints after each guess to guide players.

- **Special Hints** *(One-time use for enhanced strategy)*:
  - Is the number **Even or Odd**?
  - Is it **Greater or Less** than your current guess?
  - Is it **Divisible by 5**?

- **User-Friendly Console Interface**: 
  - Enhanced gameplay with color-coded output for easy readability.
